## Introduction to the Virtual Lab

A virtual lab interface gives students remote access to equipment in laboratories via the internet without having to be physically present near the equipment.
The idea is that lab experiments can be made accessible to a larger audience which may not have the resources to set up the experiment at their place.
Another use-case scenario is that the experiment setup must be placed at a specific location which may not be habitable.

The PSLabâ€™s capabilities can be increased significantly by setting up a framework that allows remote data acquisition and control.
It can then be deployed in various test and measurement scenarios such as an interactive environment monitoring station.

## Structure

### Backend

The virtual lab will be hosted using [Python-Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), which is a BSD Licensed microframework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2  .
It will use sqlalchemy to interface with databases containing user credentials and data. At present, postgresql will be used.

The repository has been integrated with Heroku, and modifications to the master branch are automatically deployed to pslab-stage.herokuapp.com after the CI build passes

### Frontend

The frontend code resides in a subdirectory called `frontend` . It is Designed with EmberJS , and a production build is automatically deployed to pslab-remote.surge.sh by the CI if the build is successful.

## Installing dependencies

+ Install all packages in requirements.txt
+ navigate to the frontend directory, and run `npm install`


## Running the app locally

`gunicorn app:app`
This launches the API server on default port 8000

`cd frontend`
`ember -s environment='development'`
this launches the the emberjs webapp on port 4200

navigate to localhost:4200 in your web browser
